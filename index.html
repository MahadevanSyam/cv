      <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Mahadevan Syam, a final-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student at Vellore Institute of Technology with a strong passion for embedded systems, VLSI design, and AI/ML integration. With a CGPA of 8.78 and a track record of hands-on project experience, I actively seek opportunities that combine deep technical knowledge with real-world impact.

Throughout my academic journey, I’ve been involved in impactful research and development work, including the publication of a book chapter on IoT in education and multiple technical projects such as an IoT-based health monitoring system and a deep learning solution for COVID-19 detection. Most notably, I’m currently awaiting the publication of my VLSI-focused research on a Quad-Core VCO architecture targeting 5G/mmWave systems, showcasing my proficiency in high-frequency circuit design and simulation.

Professionally, I’ve completed internships at prestigious organizations like ISRO’s Vikram Sarabhai Space Center, where I worked on FPGA-based LVDT signal conditioning, and CDAC, where I built an IoT-based health monitoring framework with live data processing and visualization. I’ve also interned at startups like iOrbit and JOL Energy, where I contributed to next-generation patient care systems and EV charger designs.

As the former Chairperson of the IEEE SPS VIT Student Chapter, I’ve led a 200+ member team, mentored juniors, and organized technical events like hackathons and workshops. These roles have helped me develop leadership, communication, and mentorship skills alongside my technical expertise.

I’m fluent in Python, C, VHDL, and web technologies, with beginner-level experience in TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn. I'm always keen to push boundaries in embedded systems, AI, and VLSI, and am actively building a profile that blends strong theoretical foundations with practical innovation.</p>
